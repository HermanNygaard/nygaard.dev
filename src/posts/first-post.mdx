Hello and welcome!  
I mainly made this blog to learn more about MDX and Tailwind, as well as a place for
myself to index and look back on for recaps on topics I found interesting,
such as [dotfiles for macOS](/blog/macos-dotfiles).

## Tech

The site uses Next.js with SSG and MDX to generate the posts and corresponding routes
directly from markdown files in the source code. It uses Tailwind for styling
and is for the time being hosted on Vercel.
