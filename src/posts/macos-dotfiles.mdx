excerpt: Manage your dotfiles with Stow Brewfile

Storing all your configs in a single place makes changing between Macs a breeze.
In this article I'll explain how I store my dotfiles for easy version control and some of the tools I use.
For now it's the bare necessities but it gets the job done.  
[My dotfiles can be found here](https://github.com/HermanNygaard/dotfiles) (feel free to fork it!)

## Symlinking with GNU Stow

Stow is a neat little program that creates symlinks to my home directory from `~/.dotfiles` by structuring
files the same way you would in your home directory:

```
~ /.dotfiles/
  - zsh/.zshrc
  - nvim/.config/nvim
```

As you can see the directory names (zsh, nvim) are just used to help you organize your dotfiles,
while the content inside is what will get symlinked to your ~ directory.  
An example:  
Zsh saves it's config directly under your home dir, `~/.zshrc`, while nvim saves its config
under `~/.config/nvim` which is why we use `.config` as the second part of the path.

After running `stow zsh && stow nvim` ~ will have these symlinks:

```
~ /
 - .zshrc
 - .config/nvim
```

This way one can easily edit and version control dotfiles in the ` ~/.dotfiles/` directory.

## Homebrew and Brewfile

To manage my packages I use Homebrew.
All installed packages can be stored in a `Brewfile`, a file with all your brew packages listed.
The command `brew bundle dump --describe` will create a Brewfile. The `describe` flag adds a short comment over
each line describing what the package does.  
Then run `brew bundle` to install all packages.  
By having a `.Brewfile` in your ~ directory it will be used as a global file,
which is convenient so you can run `bundle` or `bundle dump` anywhere with the `--global` flag.

Some apps I have in my Brewfile and recommend are:

- Rectangle, my favorite window manager for macOS
- iTerm, terminal emulator

## Visual Studio Code

For VS Code it seems like the easiest option simply is to use the Settings Sync feature in VS Code.
I would prefer a config file that you could dump all settings and extensions into, but couldn't
find an easy way to do this.

## Setup script

In the README I have a simple script you can run from a brand new Mac:

```bash
# Installs git
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/HermanNygaard/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles; source setup.sh
```

Here is the `setup.sh` script, which installs all Brew packages as well as ohmyzsh:

```
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

echo ">>>>>Installing homebrew"
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" </dev/null ## /dev/null skips pressing enter for the installation
brew bundle --file=~/.dotfiles/homebrew/.Brewfile

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Further endeavours

As my time was fairly limited when setting this up I still have some things left I want to look into:

- Create a simple script to run stow on all my directories in the setup script
- Native MacOS settings
- iTerm settings
